Analytic solutions are limited and one tries to find the approximate solution. One way to go about finding the solution for PDEs is to use the finite difference method. 

What we try to do with FEM is fundamentally quite different.

> The basis of that approach is to go from a STRONG form to the WEAK form of the PDE
