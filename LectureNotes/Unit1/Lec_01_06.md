[Lecture Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPjJoKwvYEk&list=PLJhG_d-Sp_JHKVRhfTgDqbic_4MHpltXZ&index=6)

Analytic solutions are limited and one tries to find the approximate solution. One way to go about finding the solution for PDEs is to use the finite difference method. 

What we try to do with FEM is fundamentally quite different.

> The basis of that approach is to go from a STRONG form to the WEAK form of the PDE

## Weak form of a linear elliptic PDE in 1D

Find $u(x) \in \mathbf{S}$, 
> where $\mathbf{S}$ is a *space* or a collection of **functions**

> Such that $u \rvert u(0) = u_0$, i.e. functions that satisfy the Dirichilet boundary condition, and consider Dirichilet b.c. at $x=0$ only

given $u_0$, $t$, $f(x)$ and the constitutive relation $\sigma = Eu_{,x}$, such that 

$\forall w \in V = \\\{ w \rvert w(0) = 0 \\\}$, i.e. $w$ also satisfies the Dirichilet b.c, except that it is a *"homogeneous dirichilet b.c."* and the following holds:-

$\int_{0}^{L}w_{,x}\sigma dx = \int_{0}^{L}wfdx + w(L)t$

Now multiplying with area '$A$' we get the following:-

$\int_{0}^{L}w_{,x}\sigma Adx = \int_{0}^{L}wfAdx + w(L)tA$; " $tA$ = boundary force" and " $Adx$ = volume element "

> Weak Form is the basis for the approximations that leads to the **Finite Element Method**
