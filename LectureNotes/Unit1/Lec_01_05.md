## Strong Form of elliptic PDE in 1D
  * Find $u(x)$ given $u_0$, $u_g$ (displacement at the boundary - *"Dirichlet Boundary Condition"*) or $t$ (traction at the boundary - *"Neumann Boundary Condition"*), $f(x)$, and the constitutive relation ($\sigma = Eu_{,x}$) such that -

  $\frac{d\sigma}{dx} + f(x) = 0$ for $x \in$ (0,L), with boundary conditions $u(0) = u_0$ and either $u(L)=u_g$ or $\sigma(L) = t$

  This is called the strong form for two reasons, 1) The PDE has to hold at every point in the interval which is like a STRONG condition. 2) The constitutive relation implies that
  $\frac{d(E\frac{du}{dx})}{dx} + f = 0$ in (0,L) which is another PDE that needs to be satisfied. There has to be a $u$ that allows us to take the double derivative.

> We require "*strong conditions*" of "smoothness" on $u(x)$, because the strong form has two spatial derivatives.
> We require the PDE to hold pointwise in the interval of interest i.e. $x \in$ (0,L)


## Sketch out the Analytic Solution in 1D

$\frac{d\sigma}{dx} = -f(x)$, we simply integrate this from 0 to say y which is not equal to L

$\int_{0}^{y}\frac{d\sigma}{dx} = -\int_{0}^{y}f(x)dx$, where $y \in [0,L]$

$\implies \sigma(y) - \sigma(0) = -\int_{0}^{y}f(x)dx$

$\implies Eu_{,x}\rvert_{y} - Eu_{,x}\rvert_{0} = -\int_{0}^{y}f(x)dx$

$\implies E\frac{du}{dy} = -\int_{0}^{y}f(x)dx + E\frac{du}{dx}\rvert_{0}$

Integrate it again,

$\implies \int_{0}^{z}E\frac{du}{dy}dy = -\int_{0}^{z}(\int_{0}^{y}f(x)dx)dy + \int_{0}^{z}E\frac{du}{dx}\rvert_{0}dy$

$\implies Eu(z) - Eu(0) = -\int_{0}^{z}(\int_{0}^{y}fdx)dx + E\frac{du}{dx}\rvert_0.z$

$\implies u(z) = \frac{1}{E}\bigg[Eu(0) - \int_{0}^{z}(\int_{0}^{y}fdx)dx + E\frac{du}{dx}\rvert_0.z\bigg]$

We know that $u(0) = u_0$ from the boundary condition and " $E\frac{du}{dx}\rvert_0.z$ " has to be determined by the boundary condition at $z=L$

If boundary condition at $x=L$ is a Neumann bounday condition, we first calculate $u_{,z}$ and then apply boundary condition $Eu_{,z}(L)$
