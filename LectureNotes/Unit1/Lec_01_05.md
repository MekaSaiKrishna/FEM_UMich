* Strong Form of elliptic PDE in 1D
  * Find $u(x)$ given $u_0$, $u_g$ (displacement at the boundary - *"Dirichlet Boundary Condition"*) or $t$ (traction at the boundary - *"Neumann Boundary Condition"*), $f(x)$, and the constitutive relation ($\sigma = Eu_{,x}$) such that -

  $\frac{d\sigma}{dx} + f(x) = 0$ for $x \in$ (0,L), with boundary conditions $u(0) = u_0$ and either $u(L)=u_g$ or $\sigma(L) = t$
