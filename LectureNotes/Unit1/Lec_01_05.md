* Strong Form of elliptic PDE in 1D
  * Find $u(x)$ given $u_0$, $u_g$ (displacement at the boundary - *"Dirichlet Boundary Condition"*) or $t$ (traction at the boundary - *"Neumann Boundary Condition"*), $f(x)$, and the constitutive relation ($\sigma = Eu_{,x}$) such that -

  $\frac{d\sigma}{dx} + f(x) = 0$ for $x \in$ (0,L), with boundary conditions $u(0) = u_0$ and either $u(L)=u_g$ or $\sigma(L) = t$

  This is called the strong form for two reasons, 1) The PDE has to hold at every point in the interval which is like a STRONG condition. 2) The constitutive relation implies that
  $\frac{d(E\frac{du}{dx})}{dx} + f = 0$ in (0,L) which is another PDE that needs to be satisfied. There has to be a $u$ that allows us to take the double derivative.

> We require "*strong conditions*" of "smoothness" on $u(x)$, because the strong form has two spatial derivatives.
> We require the PDE to hold pointwise in the interval of interest i.e. $x \in$ (0,L)
