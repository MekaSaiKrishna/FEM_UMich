# Unit 01: Lecture 07 - Weak form of the partial differential equation (Part 2)

[Lecture Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKdrBI8Lw9M&list=PLJhG_d-Sp_JHKVRhfTgDqbic_4MHpltXZ&index=7)

The weak form if the basis of the **Finite Element Method**, and of the other *variationally* based numerical methods

The claim is that the **strong form** and the **weak form** are equivalent.

Strong Form $\Longleftrightarrow$ Weak Form

Consider the strong form:

$\frac{d\sigma}{dx} + f = 0$ in (0,L), b.c.s $u(0)=u_0$ and $\sigma(L)=t$, with the consitutive relation $\sigma = Eu_{,x}$

___
To prove equivalence, we introduce $w \in V = \\\{w \rvert w(0) = 0 \\\}$, where $w$ = weighting function.
