[Lecture Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKdrBI8Lw9M&list=PLJhG_d-Sp_JHKVRhfTgDqbic_4MHpltXZ&index=7)

The weak form if the basis of the **Finite Element Method**, and of the other *variationally* based numerical methods

The claim is that the **strong form** and the **weak form** are equivalent.

Strong Form $\Longleftrightarrow$ Weak Form

Consider the strong form:

$\frac{d\sigma}{dx} + f = 0$ in (0,L), b.c.s $u(0)=u_0$ and $\sigma(L)=t$, with the consitutive relation $\sigma = Eu_{,x}$

___
To prove equivalence, we introduce $w \in V = \\\{w \rvert w(0) = 0 \\\}$, where $w$ = weighting function.

We will multiply $w$ with the strong form, and then integrate over (0,L)

$\implies w\frac{d\sigma}{dx} + wf = 0$

$\implies A(\int_{0}^{L}w\frac{d\sigma}{dx}dx + \int_{0}^{L}wfdx) = 0$, where A is the area

Now we will use the idea of integration by parts:-

$\implies \bigg(-\int_{0}^{L}w_{,x}\sigma A dx \bigg) + w\sigma A\bigg\rvert_{0}^{L} + \int_{0}^{L}wAfdx = 0$

$\implies \int_{0}^{L}w_{,x}\sigma A dx =  \int_{0}^{L}wAfdx + w\sigma A\bigg\rvert_{0}^{L}$

$\implies \int_{0}^{L}w_{,x}\sigma A dx =  \int_{0}^{L}wAfdx + w(L)\sigma(L)A-w(0)\sigma(0)A$

$\implies \int_{0}^{L}w_{,x}\sigma A dx =  \int_{0}^{L}wAfdx + w(L)\sigma(L)A-\cancel{w(0)}\sigma(0)A$, because $w$ follows the homogeneous dirichilet boundary condition at $x=0$.

$\implies \int_{0}^{L}w_{,x}\sigma A dx =  \int_{0}^{L}wAfdx + w(L)\cancelto{t}{\sigma(L)}A$, this is from the Neumann Boundary condition at $x=L$

Therefore, the weak form is given as:
$\boxed{\int_{0}^{L}w_{,x}\sigma A dx =  \int_{0}^{L}wAfdx + w(L)tA}$
