### To show that the weak form $\implies$ strong form 

Find $u \in \mathbf{S} = \\\{ u \rvert u(0) = u_0 \\\}$ such that $\forall w \in V = \\\{w \rvert w(0) = 0 \\\}$ and the following equation holds -

$\int_{0}^{L}w_{,x}\sigma A dx =  \int_{0}^{L}wAfdx + w(L)tA;$ (**Weak Form**)

We use integration by parts for the term on left hand side,

$\implies \int_{0}^{L}w_{,x}\sigma A dx =  \int_{0}^{L}wAfdx + w(L)tA$

$\implies -\int_{0}^{L}w\sigma_{,x} A dx + w\sigma A \bigg\rvert_{0}^{L} =  \int_{0}^{L}wAfdx + w(L)tA$

$\implies -\int_{0}^{L}w\sigma_{,x} A dx + w(L)\sigma(L) A - w(0)\sigma(0) A =  \int_{0}^{L}wAfdx + w(L)tA$

$\implies -\int_{0}^{L}w\sigma_{,x} A dx + w(L)\sigma(L) A - \cancelto{0}{w(0)}\sigma(0) A =  \int_{0}^{L}wAfdx + w(L)tA$, due the homogeneous dirichilet boundary condition on $w$

$\implies \int_{0}^{L}w\bigg(-\sigma_{,x}-f\bigg) A dx + w(L)\bigg(\sigma(L)-t\bigg) A = 0$

Now lets see under what conditions the above equation holds,

This holds $\forall w \in V = \\\{w \rvert w(0) = 0 \\\}$

$\implies$ Also holds for 

### Particular Choice for $w(x)$:
$$
\begin{equation*}
  w(x) = \begin{cases}
        \phi(x)(-\sigma_{,x}-f) \quad \text{where $\phi(x) > 0$ for $x \in (0,L)$}
        \\
        \phi(x) = 0 \quad \text{at $x=\\\{0, L\\\}$}.
        \end{cases}
 \end{equation*}
$$

For this choice of $w(x)$ we have $w(L) = 0$, therefore the manipulation on weak form would become:-

$\implies \int_{0}^{L}\cancelto{\phi(x)(-\sigma_{,x}-f)}{w}\bigg(-\sigma_{,x}-f\bigg) A dx + \cancelto{0}{w(L)}\bigg(\sigma(L)-t\bigg) A = 0$

$\implies \int_{0}^{L}\phi(x)\big(-\sigma_{,x}-f\big)^2 A dx  = 0$, and we know that $\phi(x) \gt 0$ and $\big(-\sigma_{,x}-f\big)^2  \geq 0$

So for the equation to hold it implies that $-\sigma_{,x}-f = 0$ in (0,L), which is nothing but the *PDE* of the **Strong Form!**

Now lets return to, $\int_{0}^{L}w\bigg(-\sigma_{,x}-f\bigg) A dx + w(L)\bigg(\sigma(L)-t\bigg) A = 0; \quad \forall w \in V$, now we know that $-\sigma_{,x}-f = 0$ so that leads to:-

$\implies w(L)\bigg(\sigma(L)-t\bigg) A = 0$, and this has to hold for all $w \in V$,

In particular, it also holds for a $w(x)$ such that $w(0)$ and $w(L) \neq 0$, the only way the above condition will then hold is when 

$\implies \sigma(L) - t = 0$, and this is the *Neumann boundary condition* of the **Strong Form!**.


The dirichilet boundary condition of the **Strong Form** is automatically satisfied in the weak form because we state that $u \in \mathbf{S} = \\\{ u \rvert u(0) = u_0 \\\}$
